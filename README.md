# janet-playground

A WebAssembly based playground for Janet (https://janet-lang.org)
like that of https://play.golang.org

The goal is to allow for sharing of "runnable" example code
in the Janet community. 

Currently intend to try to support deployment on a static webserver
for cost efficiency and administrative efficiency.  (The golang
playground has a dynamic back-end support server.)
