        <h1>The Janet Playground</h1>
        This page has a few examples of the potential use of the "janet-playground"
        -- https://github.com/mikebeller/janet-playground.

        <h2>Use Case A -- online Janet execution with no install</h2>
        <p>Intent is to allow for people to try Janet with no install.  Different
        from the online REPL on janet-lang.org because the multiline code window
        and "run" button (also ctrl-enter) allows for a more comfortable
        environment for trying out longer code examples.</p>

        <a href=play.html>Try out use case A here</a>

        <p>This use case requires no back end code and so it can sit on a static server.</p>

        <h2>Use Case B -- live tutorial docs</h2>
        <p>In this use case, we integrate a "run" button into examples of code
        in a web page.  For example, below is a page of the "janet-cookbook"
        modified to have runnable sample code.</p>

        <a href=cookbook.html>Try out use case B here</a>

        <p>This use case requires no back end code and so it can sit on a static server.</p>

        <h2>Use Case C -- sharing live code snippets</h2>
        <p>In this use case, we integrate a "save" button into the playground,
        which saves the code in the window and returns a unique URL which can
        be used to send to someone else so they can bring up and run that playground
        with that specific code example.  This is available in play.golang.org and is
        a huge boon to their community.  The downside is this requires a back end service
        to save the example.  The community has some active webservers (e.g.
        janet-lang.org and janetdocs.com).  Maybe this could be integrated with them?</p>

        <p>This is a work in progress so nothing to try out yet.  I am debating possible
        approaches to saving the data and interested in input.  Possible approaches:

        <ul>
            <li>Save code examples in a local database.  (e.g. sqlite would be sufficient).
                The downside is that someone needs to maintain the database. If we were
                to lose it then live examples posted in various forums would become 404s.
                This is the approach used by play.golang.org</li>
            <li>Save the code examples to a gist.  This would require some github API
                integration.  The RUST playground autogenerates gists on their own
                account when people press "save as gist" on that playground.  I wonder
                why they don't get in trouble with github for creating so many gists?
                Anyway this is certainly an alternative.</li>
        </ul>
